Characterizing the linear inertance of mechanical inerters

### Cloning the project onto your local computer (WINDOWS OS ONLY)
1. Create a new folder on your computer for the project

2. Open up the "Terminal" application. Inside the terminal of your device, you need to navigate to the directory where you created your new file.

3. By typing `dir` and pressing enter in the terminal, you can see all folders available in the current directory. To move into one of those, enter
```powershell
cd (Folder name here)
```
keep doing this until you are inside of the folder you created in step 1.

4. In the github repository, click the green `Code` button, and copy the HTTPS URL. Inside of the terminal, enter
```powershell
git clone (HTTPS Link)
```
this will copy the current version of the github repository onto the new folder you created. To push or pull changes from the repository, you must navigate into the new folder generated by this command.

5. To push new changes up to the github, enter the following lines in the terminal (while in the same directory as before)
```powershell
git add.
git commit -m "(custom message here)"
git push origin main
```
To pull changes from the repository, simply use the following command while inside the new folder created by step 4.
```powershell
git pull origin main
```
  - If you receive an error related to identity when trying to push changes, you may have to set the following variables with git in the terminal:
```powershell
git config --global user.name "(your github username here)"
git config --global user.email "(the email associated with your github here)"
